# AERO 443 2025: Regional Utility Aircraft Design
A gathering of data, models, and scripts related to the evaluation and design of a 19-passenger utility aircraft.

## Project Statement

### Project Goal
The goal of this design is to produce a small cost-effective, versatile and agile aircraft that can fulfill a wide range of transport missions, including but not limited to: civilian cargo and passenger transport in remote or regional areas; medical evacuation and humanitarian relief; military troop and equipment transport; and tactical resupply in austere environments. This design effort should take into considera5on new technologies which may be available while considering the progammatic risk implications of those technologies. Importantly, the project should also be based on an approach with a viable business model.

### Minimum Requirements
This airplane design problem allows significant leeway for the design team to focus on the characteris5cs most likely to result in a successful system. To arrive at such a focus, the designer must develop an understanding of the stakeholders and their needs and concerns and chose characteristics and capabilities where exceeding the minimum requirements will enhance the competitiveness of the aircraft. As a minimum, the airplane must meet these requirements:
* Crew: 2 (pilot and co-pilot)
* Payload: 4,000 lbs
* Range (with max payload): 500 NM
* Ferry Range: 1,000 NM
* Takeoff Distance (balanced field length, ISA, sea level, MTOW): 3,000 ft
* Landing Distance: 3,000 ft
* Service Ceiling: 25,000 ft
* Capable of operating from unpaved or semi-prepared runways
* Load/Unload Time: 30 minutes for full payload turnover
* Cabin Volume: sufficient for 19 passengers or equivalent cargo
* Cargo Door: rear or side access (must accommodate palletized cargo or stretchers)
