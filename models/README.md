# Aircraft Performance and Optimization Models

One aim is to use the performance database to model, analyze, and visualize current aircraft in the market. Reasonable estimates should be able to be achieved through drag buildup, engine modeling, and possibly dynamics simulated at specified missions that may be required. From this, any concepts can be compared for feasibility in the model space. 

In addition, trade-offs between key elements of available configurations like strut-braced wings, pressurized cabins, turbofans need to be explored. By modeling these components, they can be implemented in objective functions for optimization.
